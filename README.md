# Let's improve the Security with AWS IAM 

Security: This is by far the most imperative aspect of an organization. If your infrastructure falls into the wrong hands, your company could face severe consequences. This is why companies hire cloud security or cybersecurity engineers to address and mitigate such risks. In AWS, providing only the necessary access to users is known as the principle of least privilege. This project will explore how to create EC2 instances and secure data using the AWS IAM service. 

"Here are a few AWS best practices to enhance your knowledge."
1. Require human users to access AWS using temporary credentials using the Identity provider.
2. Require multi-factor authentication (MFA).
3. Follow best practices to protect your root user credentials.
4. Apply for least-privilege permissions.
5. Regularly review and remove unused users, roles, permissions, policies, and credentials.
6. Use conditions in IAM policies to further restrict access.
